AI-powered learning tool that diagnoses understanding gaps using Gemini 3
# Reverse Teacher AI

Reverse Teacher AI is an innovative learning application that flips the traditional teaching model. 
Instead of passively consuming content, learners explain a concept in their own words, and the system 
diagnoses their understanding gaps using the Gemini 3 API.

## 🚀 What It Does
- Accepts a user's explanation (text or voice)
- Analyzes conceptual understanding using Gemini 3
- Identifies missing or weak concepts
- Re-teaches only the required parts
- Generates targeted follow-up questions

## 🧠 Why It’s Unique
Most learning tools focus on delivering explanations. Reverse Teacher AI focuses on 
*evaluating understanding* and providing adaptive feedback, similar to a human tutor.

## 🛠 Built With
- Python
- Streamlit
- Google Gemini 3 API
- Google AI Studio
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Prompt Engineering

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
